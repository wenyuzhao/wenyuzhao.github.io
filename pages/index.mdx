# Hello ðŸŒš

I am a PhD student at The Australian National University.
I do research on computer systems, memory management and programming languages.

I also work as a casual research assisitant at ANU and tutor for the course [COMP3710 Computer Microarchitecture](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp3710-uarch).

I am a terrible gamer as well :(
