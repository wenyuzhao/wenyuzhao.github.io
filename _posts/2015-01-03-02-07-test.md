add a formula:

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

\\(d=\frac{v_0\cos{\theta}}{g}\left(v0\sin{\theta}-\sqrt{v0^2\sin^2{\theta}+2gh}\right)\\)

\\(v_0=\sqrt{}\\)

\\(d=\frac{v_0\cos{\theta}}{g}\left($v_{0}$\sin{\theta}-\sqrt{1}\right)\\)

This is a very long paragraph:

  All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. Sometimes it was as long as a year, sometimes as short as 24 hours. But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed hero chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited. 

insert code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout<<"hello, world"<<endl;
  return 0;
}
```

add a formula:

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

\\(x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\)
