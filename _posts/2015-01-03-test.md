This is a very long paragraph:

  All of us have read thrilling stories in which the hero had only a limited and specified time to live. Sometimes it was as long as a year, sometimes as short as 24 hours. But always we were interested in discovering just how the doomed hero chose to spend his last days or his last hours. I speak, of course, of free men who have a choice, not condemned criminals whose sphere of activities is strictly delimited. 

insert code:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout<<"hello, world"<<endl;
  return 0;
}
```
