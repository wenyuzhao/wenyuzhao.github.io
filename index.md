# Hello ðŸŒš

I am a PhD student at the Australian National University, under the supervision of [Prof. Steve Blackburn](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb).
I do research on computer systems, memory management and programming languages.

I also work as a casual research assistant at ANU and tutor for the course [COMP3710 Computer Microarchitecture](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp3710-uarch) (2021) and [COMP2310 Systems, Networks, and Concurrency](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2310) (2022).

I am a terrible gamer as well :(
