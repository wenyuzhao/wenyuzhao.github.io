# Hello ðŸŒš

I am a PhD student at the Australian National University, advised by [Prof. Steve Blackburn](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb), [Dr. Kathryn McKinley](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mckinley/), [Prof. Tony Hosking](https://hosking.github.io/), and [Dr. Shoaib Akram](https://shbakram.github.io/).
My research focuses on computer systems, memory management, and programming languages.

I have also worked as a casual research assistant at ANU and have tutored for [COMP3710 Computer Microarchitecture](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp3710-uarch) (2021) and [COMP2310 Systems, Networks, and Concurrency](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2310) (2022).

I am also a terrible gamer, unfortunately :(
